On 9/15, Xi Jinping hosted the welcome party for Zambia President, Hakainde Hichilema, in front of the Great Hall of the People. The very brief procedure of the welcome party is like below:
1. Listen to the National Anthems of both countries;
2. Fire the 21-gun salute (this is the welcoming the head of states, lower level will have fewer shots);
3. Inspect the Honor Guards;
4. Go back to dais and watch the Honor Guards formation;
5. Enjoy the performance of military band while marching.

Zambia President thanked the help from China in their debt problem.
