On 9/15, Xi Jinping wrote to the 10th China Railway Express International Cooperation Forum in Lianyungang, Jiangsu Province. China Railway Express, also known as Trans Eurasia Logistics, goes from China, through Mongolia, Central Asia, Russia, Belarus, and then to Europe. It is part of the effort of *Belt and Road Initiative*. Although this rail freight can save time (about half of the ocean freight time) and produce less green house gases, compared with ocean freight, the cost is not necessarily lower than the ocean freight. There are doubts that passing through central Asia areas with instability can have unexpected challenges. In addition, due to the on-going Russia-Ukraine war, the safety concern of the rail freight is increasing. It is also said the central and local China government subsidized the CR Express, as it symbolizes the success of the *Belt and Road Initiative*.
