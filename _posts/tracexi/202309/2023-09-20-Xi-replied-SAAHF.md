On 9/12, Xi Jinping replied to the Chairman of Sino-American Aviation Heritage Foundation, Jeffrey Greene and Flying Tiger veteran, Melvin McMullen. 

2 things are getting weird. One thing is there have been a couple of days that Xinwen Lianbo didn't report Xi's schedule. It is likely Xi is inspecting somewhere, or maybe in Hangzhou for the opening of Asia Olympic Games.

The other thing is earlier this month Xi replied to the grandchild of General Stilwell. Therefore, either this is a sign that Xi is going to steer away from war wolf diplomatic policy or the economy has some serious problems.
