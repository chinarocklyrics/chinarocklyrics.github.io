Another great direction Xi Jinping recently gave is to the work of the General Offices in the new era. The General Office works like a secretary office for the China Communist Party Committee in various levels. Xi pointed out that the **3 serves** are the key to do a good job in the general office. The **3 serves** are *Serve the leader*, *Serve the base*, and *Serve the people*.
