On 9/14, Xi Jinping wrote to the opening of 2023 Beijing Culture Forum. The topic is *Inherit Cultural Legacies, Promote Exchanges and Cooperations*. Greece, Egypt, Thailand, Portugal and maybe other counties sent people (who covered their expenses?). Zhang Yimou, Wang Meng, Feng Yuanzheng gave speeches.
