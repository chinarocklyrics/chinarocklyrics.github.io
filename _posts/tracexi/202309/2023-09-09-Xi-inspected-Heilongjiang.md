Xi Jinping went to inpect the north Province of Heilongjiang. Xi emphasized that Heilongjiang needed to understand its strategic position in the bigger picture of national development, which is to be the base of agriculture. Stop dreaming about industrialization. 

Xi went to Daxinganling to inspect the ecological system and found that it was very well developed but needed to be careful of mountain fire, which could destroy old trees.

Xi then went to the very northern countryside in Mohe city and felt happy when he saw his people lived really well.

After a while of the big flood in Heilongjiang, finally Xi went to see the people who were affected. Xi said he always worried about you guys and when he saw the home was being re-built, he was so released.

Xi can't miss going to visit Harbin engineering university. Xi said hello to all the teachers as the Teacher's Day was coming. In Xi's opinion, the work from HEU was fantastic, and Xi asked them to continue the good work. I have been that school before. I kind of have a bonding there. I have been a place Xi's been. How lucky!

Wow! What a busy trip!
