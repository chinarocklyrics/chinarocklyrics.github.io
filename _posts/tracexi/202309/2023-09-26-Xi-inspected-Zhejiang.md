Before the Asian Games, in Hangzhou, Xi Jinping inspected Zhejiang Province.

On 9/20, Xi Jinping visited Jinhua City, Yiwu City. Yiwu is part of Jinhua, although Yiwu is directly managed by the Zhejiang Province Government.

Later, Xi Jinping visited Fengqiao in Shaoxing and Shaoxing Grand Canal.

On 9/21, Xi held a meeting with Zhejiang higher officials.

On 9/24, on the way back to Beijing, Xi visited Zaozhuang in Shandong Province. Interestingly, Zaozhuang is located in the middle of Beijing and Hangzhou. I suspect that Xi used small bus to travel around.
